# piss

Script to manage passwords in an encrypted file using gpg.

**New!** [Purse](https://github.com/anoncam/Purse) is a fork which uses public key authentication instead of a master passphrase and can integrate with YubiKey.

# Installation

    git clone https://github.com/anoncam/piss
    
Requires `gpg` - install with `brew install gpg` or `sudo apt-get install gnupg` or build and install it from [source](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html).

# Use

Run the script interactively using `cd piss && ./piss` or symlink to a folder in `$PATH` and run directly.

Type `w` to write a password.

Type `r` to read a password.

Type `d` to delete a password.

Options can also be passed on the command line.

Create password with length of 30 characters for *gmail*:

    ./piss w gmail 30

Append `<space>q` to suppress generated password output.

Read password for *user@github*:

    ./piss r user@github

Delete password for *dropbox*:

    ./piss d dropbox

Copy password for *github* to clipboard on OS X:

    ./piss r github | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | awk 'NR==3{print $1}' | pbcopy

The script and encrypted `piss.safe` or the `bash` variable, $PISS_SAFE file can be safely shared between computers, for example through Google Drive or Dropbox.

A recommended `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` configuration file can be found at [drduh/config/gpg.conf](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg.conf).
